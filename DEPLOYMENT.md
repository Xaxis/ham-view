### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration
1. Go to your GitHub repository settings

3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. Custom domain should show `hamview.com`
6. Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

### 3. Domain Configuration (Namecheap)
Ensure your Namecheap DNS settings include:

**A Records:**
```
@ -> 185.199.108.153
@ -> 185.199.109.153
@ -> 185.199.110.153
@ -> 185.199.111.153
```

**CNAME Record:**
```
www -> hamview.com
```

### 4. Verification

  - [ ] Adding custom URLs
  - [ ] Auto-grid layout (Ctrl+G)

## 🔧 Post-Deployment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **404 errors**: Check CNAME file and GitHub Pages settings

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```
