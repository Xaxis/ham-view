# HamView üì°

**Advanced Propagation Tracking Dashboard for Ham Radio Operators**

üåê **Live Site**: [hamview.com](https://hamview.com)

## Overview

HamView is a modern, real-time propagation tracking and analysis dashboard designed specifically for amateur radio operators. It provides comprehensive insights into HF/VHF/UHF propagation conditions using live data from multiple sources.

## Features

### üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Propagation Map**
- Real-time propagation spots from PSK Reporter
- Great circle path visualization
- Aurora oval overlay with NOAA data
- Maidenhead grid overlay
- Day/night terminator
- Multiple map layers and styles

### üìä **Solar & Geomagnetic Data**
- Live solar flux index (10.7cm)
- Real-time K-index and A-index
- Solar wind speed and magnetic field data
- X-ray flux monitoring
- Geomagnetic storm alerts

### üéõÔ∏è **Advanced Filtering**
- Band-specific analysis (HF/VHF/UHF)
- Mode filtering (FT8, FT4, PSK31, CW, RTTY, etc.)
- Time range selection
- Callsign-based tracking
- Signal quality thresholds
- Geographic filtering

### üìà **Analysis Panels**
- Band conditions assessment
- Recent spots with detailed information
- Propagation quality indicators
- Real-time activity monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro + React + TypeScript
- **Mapping**: Leaflet with custom overlays
- **Data Sources**: PSK Reporter, NOAA Space Weather
